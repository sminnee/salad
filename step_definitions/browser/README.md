Web Application Testing Kit
===========================

These step definitions are intended to provide a generic, intuitive and powerful mechanism for 
building web application tests in Cucumber.  They have been originally developed for the
SilverStripe CMS but should be able to be used anywhere you find Ajax and HTML.


To do
-----

### Soon
 
 * [x] Wait for ajax
 * [x] Use <label for="X"> tags to find fields by label
 * [x] Exclude hidden fields from the search; find the first visible tab
 * [ ] Make label matchers case-insensitive

### Later

 * Allow detection of an element's colour - The "New Page" link is green.

Origin
------

These step definitions came from [Watircuke](http://github.com/richdownie/watircuke),
by Rich Downie.  They have been modified quite a bit.

No license was provided with them, so we've included this credit and our thanks. :-)
